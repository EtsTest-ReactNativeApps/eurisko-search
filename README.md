## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- NodeJS
- Code Editor
- Expo Cli
- Android Studio

### Setup

Open up a terminal (after installing Git) and run the following command:

```
  git clone https://github.com/martinnajjar12/eurisko-search.git
```

and hit Enter.

**OR**

Download a zip version of the project from [the GitHub Repo](https://github.com/martinnajjar12/eurisko-search).

### Install

To install the required dependencies run this command in your terminal:

```
  npm install
```

### Usage

Open up the Android Studio application, then navigate to the AVD Manager and choose or create a device. Then Run it.

Once your virtual device is up and running, dispatch the following command in the root directory of your project:

```
  npm start
```

Then navigate to the developer tools in the browser and click on `Run on Android Simulator`. Now you can see the app running on your virtual device.

**Note:** You may not able to run this app on Expo Go app from the Play Store or Apple Store because I'm using Fast Image package which is not supported in that application.

```
  npm test
